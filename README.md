The SomethingLikeAn Engine
==========================

----------

What It Is
----------

The SomethingLikeAn Engine is a PC-based clone of the original Legend Of
Zelda. Right now there isn't much to it, but it'll probably be awesome!

----------
How to Install/Compile/etc.
----------
This game requires SFML 2.x (found [here][1], scroll to 2.0 RC) to run, and CMake 2.6+ ([here][2]) to compile.

The details for how to compile with CMake vary from platform to platform, but here's a sample procedure for *nix:

    $ cd SomethingLikeAn
    $ mkdir build
    $ cd build
    $ cmake ..
    $ make
    $ ./SomethingLikeAn
